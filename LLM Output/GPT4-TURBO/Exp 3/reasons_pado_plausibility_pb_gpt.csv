inform,committee,ARG0,The ARG0 role for the predicate 'inform' typically represents the 'informer' or the entity providing the information.,"The argument 'committee' can serve as an agent or entity that is capable of informing or being informed, depending on the context. It implies a group of individuals with the collective capacity to receive or disseminate information.","The argument 'committee' fits well as an ARG0 for the predicate 'inform' when it acts as the informer or the entity providing information.

It may represent a communication network, social network, or any system that facilitates the exchange of information between entities.","Typically, the ARG1 role for the predicate 'inform' is filled by an agent or entity that actively communicates information. While 'network' can serve as a medium or facilitator for information dissemination, it does not conventionally fit the role of an active informer without additional context that personifies or anthropomorphizes the network as actively engaging in the act of informing. Therefore, its fit as ARG1 is context-dependent and generally less direct compared to a sentient agent."
