abandon,baby,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' should have the properties of being the agent or entity that initiates or performs the action of abandoning something or someone.,The argument 'baby' has the properties of being the entity that is being abandoned. It is the patient or theme of the action.,"The argument 'baby' does not fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' because ARG0 is typically the agent who performs the action of abandoning, whereas 'baby' is more appropriately the entity that is being abandoned, fitting a role like ARG1, which is typically the patient or theme of the action."
abandon,baby,ARG1,The entity that is being abandoned or left behind,"The argument 'baby' has the property of being a sentient being, typically requiring care and protection, which makes it a particularly vulnerable and impactful entity to be abandoned.","The argument 'baby' fits very well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'abandon', as it embodies the entity that is being left behind or given up, highlighting the emotional and ethical implications of the action."
abandon,cat,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' should have the properties of being the agent or entity that initiates the action of abandoning something or someone.,The argument 'cat' has the properties of being the entity that is being abandoned.,"The argument 'cat' does not fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon', as ARG0 is typically the agent who performs the action of abandoning, not the entity that is abandoned."
abandon,cat,ARG1,The entity that is being abandoned or left behind,"The argument 'cat' serves as the entity that is being abandoned or left behind, fitting the role of the one that is subjected to the action of being abandoned.","The argument 'cat' fits well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'abandon', as it directly serves as the entity that is being abandoned or left behind, aligning with the expected semantic role of ARG1 for this predicate."
abandon,child,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' should have the properties of being the agent or entity that initiates or performs the action of abandoning something or someone.,"The argument 'child' has the properties of being the entity that is being abandoned, typically fitting the role of ARG1 in PropBank, which is the patient, theme, or entity that undergoes the action or is affected by it.","The argument 'child' does not fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' because ARG0 is typically the agent or entity performing the action, whereas 'child' is more appropriately the entity that is being abandoned, fitting the ARG1 role."
abandon,child,ARG1,The entity that is being abandoned or left behind,"The argument 'child' has the property of being an entity that can be left behind or given up, fitting the role of something or someone that is abandoned.","The argument 'child' fits very well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'abandon', as it directly represents the entity that is being left behind or given up, which is the core requirement for this semantic role."
abandon,kidnapper,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon' should have the properties of being the agent or entity that is abandoning something or someone.,"The argument 'kidnapper' has the properties of being an agent or entity capable of abandoning something or someone, typically implying a negative or harmful action.","The argument 'kidnapper' fits well into the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'abandon', as it possesses the necessary properties of being an agent capable of performing the action of abandoning."
abandon,kidnapper,ARG1,The entity that is being abandoned or left behind,"The argument 'kidnapper' can act as an agent who abandons or as the entity being abandoned, depending on context. Typically, it would not be the prototypical entity being abandoned but could be in scenarios where the focus is on the kidnapper being left behind or forsaken by others.","Atypically, as ARG1 usually denotes the entity being abandoned. 'Kidnapper' as ARG1 suggests a scenario where the kidnapper is the one abandoned, which is less common but possible."
accept,award,ARG0,"agent, entity that accepts",entity being accepted,"Poor fit. 'Award' does not align with the expected properties of an agent or entity that accepts, which are typically required for the ARG0 role in the context of 'accept'."
accept,award,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accept' typically refers to the entity that receives or takes in something. This could be a person who accepts an offer, invitation, challenge, or responsibility, or it could be an entity acknowledging the truth or validity of something.","The argument 'award' has properties of being an object or entity that can be received or acknowledged. It implies a recognition or honor that is being accepted by someone, typically reflecting a positive evaluation or achievement.","The argument 'award' fits the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accept' as the recipient or entity acknowledging the receipt of something, in this case, a recognition or honor. However, typically ARG1 is the entity doing the accepting, so 'award' would more naturally fit a role like ARG2 in contexts where ARG2 represents the thing being accepted. If 'award' is intended to be the recipient of the action, there might be a misunderstanding, as it is usually the entity (person or organization) that receives the award. Therefore, for 'accept', ARG1 would more accurately be the person or entity that accepts, and 'award' would fit a different role that represents the object being accepted."
accept,friend,ARG0,"agent, acceptor, entity that receives or agrees to something","potential acceptor, capable of agreement or reception, social entity","Good fit as an agent capable of accepting, agreeing, or receiving."
accept,friend,ARG1,"The ARG1 of 'accept' typically refers to the entity receiving or taking in what is offered or presented. This can be a person, group, or organization that agrees to take something that is offered, such as a gift, proposal, idea, or challenge.","The argument 'friend' can be seen as an entity capable of performing the action of accepting, potentially fitting as an agent in contexts where 'accept' is used in a sense that involves an entity agreeing to or receiving something willingly. However, without additional context specifying what the 'friend' is accepting, it's not fully clear how well it fits the typical ARG1 role of 'accept', which often involves the acceptance of objects, ideas, proposals, etc., rather than people.","The argument 'friend' does not directly fit the typical PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accept', as ARG1 usually refers to the entity that is accepting something rather than being what is accepted. Without additional context indicating that the 'friend' is the one doing the accepting, the semantic fit is unclear."
accept,neighbor,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accept' typically refers to the entity that receives or takes in something. This entity is usually a person, organization, or system that agrees to receive, take, or acknowledge something being offered or presented to them.","The argument 'neighbor' can possess properties relevant to being an entity capable of accepting something, typically implying a person or an organization. This suggests the 'neighbor' can engage in social or transactional interactions where acceptance is a possible action.","The argument 'neighbor' fits well into the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accept', as it represents an entity (typically a person) capable of engaging in the act of accepting, which aligns with the properties expected of ARG0 for this predicate."
accept,neighbor,ARG1,The ARG1 of 'accept' typically refers to the entity receiving or agreeing to something. It is the thing or person that is accepted or agreed upon.,"The argument 'neighbor' can be seen as an entity that is being accepted, potentially in a social context or community setting, indicating the neighbor is being welcomed or integrated.","The argument 'neighbor' fits well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accept', as it can represent an entity being accepted or welcomed, aligning with the role's requirement for an entity receiving or agreeing to something."
accept,student,ARG0,The entity that receives or takes in something,"The argument 'student' can be an entity that is capable of receiving, taking in, or agreeing to something, such as an offer, idea, or responsibility.","The argument 'student' fits well as PropBank ARG0 for the predicate 'accept', as ARG0 typically represents the entity that receives, agrees to, or takes in something, which a student can do in various contexts (e.g., accepting an offer, idea, responsibility, etc.)."
accept,student,ARG1,"The ARG1 of 'accept' typically refers to the entity receiving or taking in something offered or proposed. This can be a person, group, or organization that agrees to receive or acknowledge something such as a gift, offer, idea, plan, or agreement.","The argument 'student' can be an entity capable of receiving or acknowledging something offered, such as an admission offer from a university, a gift, or an idea. It implies the student is in a position to agree to or consent to something being proposed to them.","The argument 'student' fits well with the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accept', as it denotes an entity that is capable of receiving, agreeing to, or acknowledging something offered, such as an admission offer, which aligns with the properties expected of ARG1 in this context."
accept,teenager,ARG0,"agent, acceptor, entity that receives or agrees to something","potential acceptor, capable of agreeing to or receiving something","Good fit as an agent or acceptor, capable of agreeing to or receiving something"
accept,teenager,ARG1,"The ARG1 of 'accept' typically refers to the entity receiving or agreeing to receive something, or consenting to a proposal or condition.

accuse,criminal,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' should have the properties of being the accuser or the entity that makes the accusation.,"The argument 'criminal' has the relevant property of being potentially the accused party or subject of the accusation, typically not the accuser.","Poorly, as ARG0 typically represents the accuser, not the accused."
accuse,criminal,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'criminal' implies an entity typically involved in illegal activities. However, for the predicate 'accuse', this argument does not directly align with the expected semantic role of the accuser (ARG1), which is the entity making the accusation, or the accused (ARG2), which is the entity being accused. The term 'criminal' is more closely related to the content or reason for the accusation rather than the roles of accuser or accused.","The argument 'criminal' does not fit well with the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse', as ARG1 is expected to be the accuser, not the entity being accused or related to the nature of the accusation."
accuse,defendant,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' should have the properties of being the accuser or the entity that makes the accusation.,The argument 'defendant' typically has the properties of being the individual or entity that is being accused or charged with a crime or wrongdoing in a legal context.,"The argument 'defendant' does not fit well with the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse', as ARG0 is typically the accuser, not the one being accused."
accuse,defendant,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'defendant' typically refers to the individual or entity being accused or charged with a crime or wrongdoing, not the one doing the accusing. For the predicate 'accuse', 'defendant' would more appropriately fit a role representing the party being accused rather than the accuser.","Poorly, as ARG1 for 'accuse' should be the accuser, not the accused."
accuse,dog,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' should have the properties of being the accuser or the entity that makes the accusation.,"The argument 'dog' has the property of being a potential agent capable of performing actions, though in the context of 'accuse', it is atypical as accusers are usually humans or entities capable of verbal communication and understanding legal or moral frameworks.","Poorly, as the typical properties of ARG0 for 'accuse' involve being capable of making an accusation through verbal communication or understanding of legal/moral frameworks, which does not align well with the capabilities of a dog."
accuse,dog,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'dog' as applied to the predicate 'accuse' is atypical, as it suggests a non-human agent performing the action of accusing, which generally requires the ability to communicate complex thoughts or intentions, a characteristic usually not attributed to dogs.","Poorly, as the ARG1 role typically implies an agent capable of making an accusation, which is a behavior not typically associated with dogs."
accuse,prosecutor,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the accuser, the entity that makes an accusation against someone else.","The argument 'prosecutor' has the relevant properties of being an agent or actor capable of making an accusation, typically in a legal context. This aligns well with the expected role of ARG0 for the predicate 'accuse', which is the accuser.","The argument 'prosecutor' fits very well into the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse', as it embodies the characteristics of an accuser, especially in legal contexts."
accuse,prosecutor,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'prosecutor' has the relevant properties of being an entity capable of performing the action of accusing, typically in a legal context, representing the accuser or the state in a court of law.","The argument 'prosecutor' fits very well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse', as it embodies the characteristics of an accuser, particularly in legal contexts."
accuse,suspect,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' should have the properties of being the accuser or the entity that makes the accusation.,"The argument 'suspect' has the properties of being the entity that is believed or alleged to have committed an offense or wrongdoing, typically the one being accused.","The argument 'suspect' does not fit well with the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse', as ARG0 is typically the accuser, not the one being accused."
accuse,suspect,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'suspect' typically refers to the entity that is being accused, which is not the typical role for ARG1 in the context of 'accuse'. ARG1 usually refers to the accuser, not the accused. However, 'suspect' could be relevant as an argument in a broader narrative context where roles and perspectives are discussed or inverted, but it does not fit the conventional semantic properties of ARG1 for 'accuse'.","The argument 'suspect' does not fit the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse', as ARG1 is typically the accuser, not the accused."
accuse,witness,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' should have the properties of being the accuser or the entity that makes the accusation.,"The argument 'witness' can potentially possess the properties of being an observer or someone who has seen or heard something relevant, potentially making them capable of making an accusation based on their observations.","The argument 'witness' fits the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'accuse' as a plausible accuser, given their potential role as an observer with relevant information that could lead to making an accusation."
accuse,witness,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' typically refers to the entity that is doing the accusing, often a person or an organization.","The argument 'witness' can act as an agent or entity that performs the action of accusing, implying it has the capacity for agency and participation in legal or conflict situations.",The argument 'witness' fits well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'accuse' as it possesses the necessary agency and participation in contexts relevant to the action of accusing.
admire,actress,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' should have properties indicating an agent who admires, typically a person or a group of people who feel admiration or respect towards someone or something.","The argument 'actress' has properties indicating a person, specifically a female who acts in plays, movies, or television shows, and can be the target of admiration, fitting as either ARG0 (the admirer, if the context implies the actress admires someone or something) or more commonly ARG1 (the entity being admired) in the context of the predicate 'admire'.","The argument 'actress' fits the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' as an atypical or less likely agent, since ARG0 typically represents the admirer. In most contexts, 'actress' would more naturally fit as ARG1, the entity being admired. However, if the context specifically indicates that the actress admires someone or something, then she can fit the ARG0 role as the admirer."
admire,actress,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'admire' should have the properties of being the entity that is admired, typically a person, group, or an abstract concept that is the recipient of the admiration.","The argument 'actress' has the relevant properties of being a person, specifically someone who performs in films, television, theater, or other dramatic productions, and can be the recipient of admiration for their skills, performances, or achievements.","The argument 'actress' fits the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'admire' very well, as it aligns with the requirement of being an entity (in this case, a person) that can be admired for their skills, performances, or achievements."
admire,athlete,ARG0,The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' should have the properties of being an admirer or someone who holds admiration.,"The argument 'athlete' has properties of being an individual who engages in physical sports, possibly possessing skills, achievements, or qualities that are admirable or worthy of respect.","The argument 'athlete' does not fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' because ARG0 should be the admirer, not the one being admired."

'Athlete' would more appropriately fit a role as the target of admiration, typically ARG0 or another role depending on the specific framing of the predicate in PropBank."
admire,disciple,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' should have the properties of being an agent or experiencer, typically a person or group of people who feels admiration towards someone or something.","The argument 'disciple' has properties of being a potential admirer, typically a person who may hold someone in high regard or respect, often implying a relationship of learning or mentorship.","The argument 'disciple' fits well into the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire', as it embodies the properties of an agent or experiencer, specifically a person who is likely to feel admiration towards someone, often in a learning or mentorship context."

admire,fan,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'admire' typically refers to the admirer, the entity that performs the action of admiring. This role is usually filled by a person or a group of people who express admiration towards someone or something.","The argument 'fan' has properties relevant to being an admirer, such as being an entity (typically a person) capable of feeling or expressing admiration towards someone or something. This aligns well with the typical role of ARG1 in the context of the predicate 'admire', which is the admirer.","The argument 'fan' fits well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'admire', as it embodies the characteristics of an admirer, which is precisely what ARG1 represents in this context."
admire,groupie,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire' should have properties indicating an agent or experiencer, specifically the person or entity that feels admiration towards someone or something.","The argument 'groupie' has properties indicating it is likely to be an experiencer or agent, typically a person who admires a particular celebrity, band, or public figure, often with great enthusiasm or devotion.","The argument 'groupie' fits well with the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'admire', as it embodies the properties of an experiencer or agent who feels admiration towards someone, aligning with the expected characteristics of ARG0 for this predicate."

adopt,baby,ARG0,"adopter, entity that takes on something","adoptee, entity that is taken on or accepted",Poor fit. The argument 'baby' fits better as an ARG1 (adoptee) rather than ARG0 (adopter) for the predicate 'adopt'.
adopt,baby,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'adopt' typically refers to the entity that adopts or takes up something. This could be an individual, a group of people, or an organization that is adopting a child, pet, policy, method, or idea.","The argument 'baby' has properties relevant to being a living being, specifically a very young child, who can be adopted by an individual or a couple as part of a legal process to become their child.","The argument 'baby' fits very well with the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'adopt', as ARG1 typically refers to the entity that is adopting. In common usage, however, 'baby' would be the entity being adopted, which aligns more closely with ARG2 in typical PropBank frames for 'adopt'. Therefore, for clarity, 'baby' as ARG1 might not be the standard semantic role assignment in PropBank for this specific context, indicating a need for adjustment in the description provided."
adopt,child,ARG0,"adopter, entity that takes on the responsibility or legal guardianship","adoptee, individual who is taken into another's family through legal means","The argument 'child' does not fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'adopt', as ARG0 is typically the adopter, not the adoptee."

This entity is the recipient of care, upbringing, and legal guardianship.","The argument 'child' does not fit the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'adopt' as described. ARG1 typically refers to the adopter, not the one being adopted. Therefore, 'child' would more accurately fit a role describing the entity being adopted, such as ARG2 in many PropBank frames, rather than ARG1 which is reserved for the adopter."
adopt,committee,ARG0,"adopter, entity that takes on the responsibility or ownership","group, decision-making body, entity capable of adopting policies or resolutions","Good fit, as a committee is an entity capable of adopting policies, resolutions, or changes, aligning with the expected properties of an adopter in the ARG0 role for 'adopt'."
adopt,committee,ARG1,"The ARG1 of 'adopt' typically refers to the entity that adopts or takes up something, such as a person adopting a child, a country adopting a policy, or an individual adopting a new method or approach.","The argument 'committee' can act as an adopting entity, capable of adopting policies, resolutions, or recommendations.

This can be an individual, a couple, or an organization that becomes the legal guardian or assumes a similar role for someone or something else.","The argument 'policy' when adopted, refers to a course of action or a set of rules being accepted or implemented by an individual, organization, or government. It implies a decision-making process and the intention to follow a specific guideline or strategy.","The argument 'policy' does not typically fit the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'adopt', as ARG1 usually refers to the adopter (an individual, couple, or organization) rather than what is being adopted.

applaud,actress,ARG0,"The PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'applaud' should have the properties of being an agent or causer of the action, typically representing the person or group of people who are clapping or showing approval.",The argument 'actress' has the properties of being a potential recipient of the action (the one being applauded) rather than the agent or causer of the action. It represents a person who may perform in a way that could elicit applause.,"Poorly, as 'actress' fits better as a recipient of the action (e.g., ARG1) rather than the agent or causer of the action specified by ARG0 in the context of 'applaud'."

Instead, 'director' might more commonly fit roles such as the beneficiary or the cause for the applause, depending on the sentence structure.","The argument 'director' does not typically fit the PropBank ARG0 role for the predicate 'applaud', as ARG0 is expected to be the agent or causer of the action (the one doing the applauding), and 'director' is more likely to be the recipient of the applause or the reason for applauding, not the one performing the action."
applaud,director,ARG1,"The PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'applaud' typically refers to the entity that is doing the applauding, often a person or a group of people.","The argument 'director' can act as an agent performing the action of applauding, indicating a person or entity capable of expressing approval or praise through clapping.","The argument 'director' fits well into the PropBank ARG1 role for the predicate 'applaud' as it represents an entity capable of performing the action of applauding, aligning with the expected properties of an agent in this context."
